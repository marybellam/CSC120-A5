I first made the attributes in the engine class private. Then I fized the refuel method in the engine class, so the fuel cannot be below zero. Then, I made it so that the passenger cannot board multiple times. Then, I fixed the print manifest to print out the names of the passengers. Then I removed the redundant fields of the train class. I made sure that the program wont crash or freeze and added javadoc comments and placed them correctly.
