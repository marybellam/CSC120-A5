- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
My initial impressions of how association affects my programing would be that it made things much more organized and easy to split up. Something that worked was trying to make the constructors and initializing. What didn't work figuring out the train method, as it was difficult to split up and it was hard to understand how each of the classes communicates with each other.
